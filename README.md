# alifesgame
A Life's Game is an agent-based predator-prey model, written in Javascript. It is highly under developement. 

The aim is to view a simulation of the Lotka-Volterra model using the Agent Based framework. We want to provide a simple graphic example of a closed world with two (or more) species interacting. Furthermore, since we want to build a self-explanatory frame, the target is mainly didactic.

If you want to contribute our aims are:

    OPTIMIZATION of the performance and the speed of simulation,
    GENERALIZATION of the model,
    IMPROVEMENT of the user interface: we want it to be simple.

We wrote a JS hierarchy to simulate the model (it's not the simplest thing to read but we gave it a try since we are mainly c++ programmers): for this reason the code is buggy right now.

The full code can be found on Github and has been developed by Nicola Sella and Gabriele Labanca as a portfolio project, approached mostly because of a childish excitement in seeing little things moving.

The project is fully written in HTML, CSS and Javascript with the help of d3js, JQuery, JQueryUI and Bootstrap.
